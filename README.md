The above is a new way to look at the idea of tackling missing data 
On the code,
we have looke at interpolation techniques(quadratic, linear, cubic spline ) all of this have given us a very clear path of the idea of imputing new data.
This idea and look came from a youtuber called TrentDoesMath he has given alot of light to the path.
The cubic spline interpolation technique is very complex and ideal since with it is more accurate  for the data field in interpolation.
The idea of using regression instead of interpolation also came up but regression is more of predicting values from the whole dataset.
Unlike interpolation which is more of a cleaning tool which directly uses data points available to fill in the gaps.
